The bitcoin blockchain stores all addresses ever used and transactions between them.

Since all transactions between addresses are transparent, you can see how much money has gone from one owner to another (this is called cash flow).

It is necessary to calculate cash flow between two clusters of addresses.

How many bitcoins did cluster 1 send to cluster 2 and how many bitcoins did cluster 2 send to cluster 1?
How many bitcoins did cluster 1 send to cluster 0 and how many did cluster 0 send to cluster 1?
How many bitcoins did cluster 2 send to cluster 0 and how many did cluster 0 send to cluster 2?
How many bitcoins did cluster 1 and cluster 2 spend on fee?
